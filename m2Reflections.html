										This section presents reflections on the Network Information Security Management process and on the implications of regulations and standards on Information Security Management based on my work and personal development achieved during this module.</br></br>
										Nowadays network security remains a major issue for organisations due to the ever-evolving distributed botnet attacks that can eventually turn into Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) or into data breaches. The consequences of these events can be disastrous for organisations as they imply financial costs, reputation damage, operational disruptions and legal consequences (Davis, 2019). To address these problems, organisations not only must put security measures in place to prevent eventual attacks, but also perform regular network security assessments to find vulnerabilities that can expose their systems.</br></br>
										A robust network security infrastructure is very important to prevent unauthorized access to network resources that can lead to attacks. To achieve this protection, it is important to monitor network access and to analyse systems and network traffic to detect sophisticated attacks (Chen et al., 2013). Common tools for network security include Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Anti-Virus Gateways and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).</br></br>
										Penetration testing is an important part of the network security assessment as it evaluates network and application security by performing an attack simulation (Satria et al., 2018). The purpose of the simulation is to find system weaknesses and vulnerabilities and try to exploit them. The vulnerabilities found are then reported to the system owner so that key security issues can be patched. As stated by Tang (2014), vulnerability assessment and penetration testing are an efficient way to identify security issues because expert penetration testers can review the security issues and associate a risk rating to each of them. They can identify vulnerabilities that may not be obvious or widely known. For this reason, it is recommended that organisations perform regular penetration testing exercises.</br></br>
										As explained in the Artifacts section, during this module, we worked as a group and had the opportunity to perform a penetration testing against a web application. This exercise helped us to achieve the first objective of the module, namely, to identify and analyse security risks and vulnerabilities in IT network systems. To do the exercise we researched about the open-source penetration test tools most commonly used by security experts in specialised sites and blogs like for example the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) or SANS Penetration testing. One tool recommended by many experts is the Kali Linux which is an open source distributed modern day platform to perform penetration testing. It is a basic Linux installation with no standard applications installed, it just provides specific commands targeted towards network and security reconnaissance. The default settings are also oriented to security as the only user installed is the root user. The reason for this is because many penetration testing tools require super-user permissions.</br></br> 
										As Leroux (2020) points out, even if the Kali Linux is the preferred tool by security experts, it might not be the tool for all penetration testing exercises. Many users may not find it user friendly as it does not have an interface but uses the command prompt. Users should be technical oriented as the tool requires knowledge about network commands and network privileges. Depending on the situation, organisations may choose to select other tools that facilitate the task by running the tests in the background and producing an automated report. On the other hand, Kali Linux offers total flexibility for the scanning process allowing testers to tailor the scan to the areas that show more vulnerabilities, and this might the reason for its popularity among experts. Another crucial thing to consider for organisations is the virtualisation of the target system. Virtualisation allows to perform tests on a replica of the target system ensuring that the real one is not overflooded. Furthermore, it allows to take snapshots through the testing process (Bhatt, 2018).</br></br>
										As for the exercise, all team members found this activity very useful as it allowed us to try the basics of penetration testing on a real environment set-up and to acquire a fair knowledge of the penetration testing procedure. For the procedure we looked at the Penetration Testing Methodologies for web applications provided by the OWASP framework (OWASP, N.D.). The procedure we used can be divided into three stages, (1) reconnaissance stage to gather information about the components of the target system, including web application, operating system, host servers and the services they operate, to determine possibly vulnerable components, (2) exploit stage, where the vulnerabilities found are exploited to test the robustness of the system, and (3) reporting of the results to the application owner so that the security holes can be patched. Examples of the commands used can be seen in the Penetration Testing section in the Artifacts page.</br></br>
										The work done with regulations and standards in the last part of the module allowed us to realise their relevance in the Information Security Management due to the importance of maintaining data confidentiality. In our Executive Summary assignment, we worked with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) because we analysed an e-commerce website. With the rapidly growing number of retail sales websites in recent years, the PCI-DSS standard has been introduced to protect card payment data. This standard defines a number of default technical requirements for creating secure e-commerce products and solutions. In our work for the Executive summary assignment, we matched the vulnerabilities discovered during the scanning of the e-commerce website with business risks and we used the PCI requirements to show that vulnerabilities can cause non-compliance with the standard. The GDPR standard improves the protection of personal data by setting requirements for what organisations must do when they process personal data. GDPR requirements are more regulatory than technical but affect e-commerce websites because they have to be designed to follow the requirements. The main requirements for e-commerce websites are to have a public privacy policy describing how data protection is applied and to implement mechanisms for taking consent from customers before collecting personal data. Organisations must follow these requisites, otherwise they may face fines for non-compliance or if there is a data breach. The cases we studied during the Protection Commission study cases exercise were useful for us to see how the non-compliance can occur in different environments. All the work done with standards and regulations helped us to gain knowledge in this area which is important in order to achieve the goal for the learning outcome 4: Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by information security professionals.</br></br>
