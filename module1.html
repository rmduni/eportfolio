												<h3>Discussion Topic: Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</h3>
												<p>The discussion thread is about the security concerns posed by smart home devices connected to the Internet. Each day vendors find new convenient devices to control all sorts of home appliances, clocks, speakers, lights, doorbells, cameras, windows, etc. It is a known issue that the majority of vendors do not put enough consideration on properly secure the devices, failures in implementing security recommendations include hardcoded passwords and unpatched known vulnerabilities. As pointed by Arunanthy (2021) a survey conducted by Consumers International and the Internet Society in 2019 shows that the poor security affects customer trust negatively as 28% of the customers that participated in the survey said that they were not buying this technology due to security concerns.</br>

The security weaknesses in smart home devices are exploited by attackers for different purposes. The most common type of attack is distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). Basey (2021) talked about the Mirai botnet attack on October 2016. This was the first major DDoS cyberattack using IoT devices. A large number of webcams, compromised by the Mirai botnet malware, were used to generate a massive flood of network traffic targeted at Dyn, a company that offers domain name services (Beek, 2017). As a result of the attack websites from well-known companies including Twitter, Netflix, Reddit and many others were down. Other common threads using smart home devices include gaining access to smart home thermostats to control when the house is occupied or gaining control over the door lock.</br>

With the increase of IoT devices estimated to 75 billion devices by 2025 by Statica research (2016), there is an urgent need of governmental regulations in the field of smart home devices in order to effectively protect customers and support the long-term growth of the IoT market. In this respect, the UK government announced in 2020 the introduction of new legislation with security requirements for IoT device manufacturers (UK government, 2020). Wilson (2021) also mentioned the importance of user training and awareness as an essential measure to guarantee the correct configuration of the smart home devices to minimise the risk of attacks.</br>

												<h3>Discussion Topic: Identify and discuss two security technologies and the context in which they can be employed.</h3>
												<p>
All the discussion threads in the forum about security technologies have been interesting and instructive. The technologies focused on in this thread are Firewalls and big data analytics applied to cybersecurity.</br>

There has been a lot of contributions from peers about big data and artificial intelligence (AI) applied to cyber security. This is one of the current research trends in cyber security. Two new type of solutions are emerging to respond to recent advanced attacks based on social engineering and machine learning. One of the solutions being explored is the Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR), which detects threats in real time by adding intelligent automation to two existing technologies, Security information and event management (SIEM) and incident response. The second solution is the User and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA). It “constantly monitors a user’s behaviour, actions, privileges, locations, and additional factors to determine a user’s risk level. When risk scores pass a threshold, security staff is alerted” (Walker, 2019).</br>

The application of big data analytics and AI in the cyber security field is rapidly growing. Cisco Talos is one leading organisation in the implementation of AI solutions (Kin, 2021). Their solutions focus on visibility for better protection and apply intelligent automation to a wide range of areas including threat detection and interdiction, vulnerability discovery and incident response (Cisco, n.d.). On the other hand, as stated by Mengesha (2021) the need of securing AI data is critical. The use of AI for security purposes makes systems a more attractive target for attacks and the consequences of a successful attack are much more severe. One of the major risks of this technology is the decision-making processes or the data integrity being compromised (Wolf, 2020), therefore a strict control of the AI data and processes is essential to ensure protection. In recent years, many countries have proposed or implemented security-focused policies for AI. (Wolf, 2020).</br>

Regarding Firewalls, Alkam (2021) made a very interesting point about Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) as a mean to improve traditional firewalls protection. A traditional firewall filters incoming and outgoing network traffic in order to protect internal networks from attacks generated on the Internet. NGFWs additional features include application-level inspection to detect and block risky applications, intrusion prevention and cloud-based threat intelligence. With these features, NGFWs introduce the ability to detect and block threats like advanced malware and application layer attacks.</br></br>
