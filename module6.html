										<h3>Artefacts</h3>
										<p>
										Throughout the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, there have been different pieces of work completed. These include two different discussion threads with peers that helped us to build an understanding of scientific research and the corresponding ethical considerations, practical exercises to improve the knowledge of quantitative data analysis that helped us to draw accurate conclusions, and other artifacts focused on professional development and project management. Finally, the Literature Review and Project Proposal Presentation assignments helped us to improve our research skills in a manner that will benefit our research work for the dissertation project.

										<h3>Reflection</h3>
										<p>
											During the Research Methods and Professional Practice Module we have produced plenty of <a href="m6Artifacts.html">key artifacts</a> that have developed our expertise in academic research. The skills gained during this module will certainly be beneficial for the dissertation project.</br></br>
											TECHNICAL SKILLS</br></br>
											Since I had no experience in academic research prior to this module I found the task of producing a Literature Review and a Project Proposal quite overwhelming. However, adopting a formal approach helped me to be more effective with the tasks of finding and evaluating literature associated with the topic of research (Louisville University, 2022). With this approach, the collected literature sources were <a href="files/m6/U7-LiteratureReviewSources.xlsx">recorded</a> and classified by subject to help me identify appropriate sources for the topic. Another useful tool for managing literature sources that I have discovered during this module is the Mendeley Reference Manager (Mendeley, 2021) which I intend to use for my dissertation project.</br></br>
											The purpose of the literature review in a research project is to gain an understanding of how well the research topic is covered and identify relevant gaps (Snyder, 2019). The literature review process entails a lot of reading and during this module I have learnt to be more efficient in reading papers by evaluating the papers before starting to read them in detail. From my experience in searching for sources that contribute to the research topic, I found that subscribing to email notifications from research publications websites such as IEEE or Research Gate helps to find new research papers on the topic as well as papers with contrasting opinions. The literature review process also led to changes in my research question as the question was refined in order to cover the literature gap identified. Given the importance of choosing an appropriate research question (Sage Campus, 2020) having gone through the process will be beneficial for identifying research questions for the dissertation project.</br></br>
											The concepts of data analysis and research methods were also extensively covered in the module.  We learned about the differences of quantitative and qualitative research, primary and secondary data collection, and the methods for analysing each type of data (Dawson, 2015; Berenson et al., 2015). Since my research proposal was based on qualitative data, I have naturally acquired more experience in qualitative research. However, the statistical exercises included in the module were helpful to understand the types of analysis used for quantitative data (<a href="files/m6/U8-Exe8.1B.xlsx">Exercise 1</a>, <a href="files/m6/U8-Exe8.2B.xlsx">Exercise 2</a>, <a href="files/m6/U8-Exe8.3D.xlsx">Exercise 3</a>, <a href="files/m6/U8-Exe8.4G.xlsx">Exercise 4</a>, <a href="files/m6/U8-Exe8.6C.xlsx">Exercise 5</a>). I will be able to apply these concepts in my dissertation project as it is likely to involve data analysis. This knowledge will also be applicable to my professional work as we are currently developing a workload statistics dashboard for management. For these reasons in my <a href="files/m6/U11-ActionPlanTemplate.docx">action plan</a>, I have included an item to develop data science skills which will be useful for both the dissertation and this professional project.</br></br>
											During the module, several real-life research cases about the importance of ethics for cybersecurity professionals were presented to us. We engaged in discussions with peers about the subject (<a href="files/m6/U1-CD1InitialPost.docx">Initial Post</a>, <a href="files/m6/U3-CD1SummaryPost.docx">Summary Post</a>) and this made us realize the importance of integrating ethical considerations in the IT professional work taking into account the rapid advance of technology and the lack of legislation to govern ethics this field. Real-life cases of ethics in research were also discussed (<a href="files/m6/U7-CD2InitialPost.docx">Initial Post</a>, <a href="files/m6/U8-CD2PeerResponse1.docx">Peer Response</a>, <a href="files/m6/U8-CD2PeerResponse2.docx">Peer Response</a>, <a href="files/m6/U9-CD2SummaryPost.docx">Summary Post</a>). The discussions underlined the importance of conducting ethical research and follow data protection regulations. With my research proposal which involved primary data research about vulnerable people, I learned that the process of getting consent is very complex in these cases as it involves written consent from parents or guardians. I intend to apply these ethical considerations in my dissertation project.</br></br>
											ASSIGNMENTS</br></br>
											The main assignments of the module were the <a href="files/m6/U7-LiteratureReview.docx">Literature review</a> and the <a href="files/m6/U10-ResearchProposalPresentation.pptx">Research Proposal Presentation</a>. The initial idea for the topic of my literature review was assistive technology for speech and impaired people. After initial research the topic revealed to be too broad, and the tutor advised me to focus the review on how assistive technology can support students with hearing and speech disabilities which facilitated the research of sources for the review. The literature review provided in-depth analysis on the topic and was a good base for preparing the research proposal. After finishing the literature review, I found more interesting information about the topic, and this was included in the research proposal. The research proposal provided a different perspective of the research requiring us to think about the aims and objectives, refine the research question, assess risks, and plan the steps of the research. While assessing the risks of my research proposal I realised that the difficulties for data collection and analysis might jeopardize de feasibility of the research (Mayernik et al, 2020) and I will take this into consideration when finding a topic for my dissertation. The oral presentation was challenging as the time constrains and required clear orally paced presentation restricted the content length. However, I was able to deliver a quality presentation thanks to structured content and presentation rehearsals which helped me increase the speech rate. The final research proposal and the feedback from tutor highlighted the fact that the research question was unfocused and needed to be more concrete. I believe that this experience will also help me to be more accurate in selecting the research question for my dissertation project.</br></br>
											Apart from these two assignments this module included a lot of formative assignments as well as reading. Time management has been an important aspect to achieve the expected work besides a full-time job. Along the module, I have developed my time management skills and was able to organise myself in order to complete all the assignments within the deadlines by planning the week’s work in a daily agenda for the tasks of the week.</br></br>
											CONCLUSION</br></br>
											Overall, this module has been great preparation for dissertation project. After all the work done, I feel more confident to approach the dissertation module and to complete a research proposal. I have developed my research capabilities and I know the steps, key aspects, and considerations to accomplish a successful research project. I know I am able to do relevant tasks for the research process including performing literature review, defining appropriate research question, assessing and managing risks, designing and performing data analysis and planning the research timeline. Finally, the <a href="files/m6/U11-ProfessionalSkillsMatrix.xlsx">skills matrix</a> completed at the end of the module allowed to see areas for improvement for the final project.</br></br>
