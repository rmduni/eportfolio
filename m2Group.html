										At the start of the module, we were informed that we were going to work in teams for most of the assignments of the module. I thought this was a big challenge as it would make tasks more difficult, but teamwork proved useful in many ways. For my personal development it was beneficial to have technically skilled team members willing to share knowledge and help. This was particularly evident in the network vulnerability scanning exercise where I got help from my team members to configure the Kali Linux platform and the AWS environment. This allowed me to expand my technical knowledge about network fundamentals and network tools. Another advantage of teamwork was that we were able to use the best skills of each team member. For example, my contribution was more on the organisational and time management side, and my skills were more relevant during the part where we work with regulations and standards. Overall, the synergy of the group was positive, and we worked well together.</br></br>
										The advice and guidelines provided on the Essex University learning <a target="blank" href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=524322">platform</a> were very helpful to set the fundamentals for the way we were going to work together. Following their advice, we signed a <a target="blank" href="https://rmduni.github.io/eportfolio/files/m2TeamContract.pdf">team contract</a>. We decided not to appoint a fixed a team leader but appoint the lead according to needs. There was continuous engagement in team activities from all team members through the module and we worked in an organised manner according to the expectations defined in the team contract regarding weekly meetings, task assignation and respected deadlines. The feedback received from the tutor is in line with these statements.
